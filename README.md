# odin-recipes

Hello, my name is Johannes.
This is my first project within the "TheOdinProject"-course.

In this Project, I will create 1 Webpage as a collection side
for recipes with 3 sub pages. Those sub pages will each show
on recipe with a picture, a description, ingredients and 
a "how-to-manuel", that are displayed in ordered and unordered
lists.

You can get access to those sub pages via a link from the index
page.

Enjoy my work.
