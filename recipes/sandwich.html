    <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 Slices of chicken breast fillet cold cuts (less for large slices)</li>
        <li>12 slices of breakfast bacon</li>
        <li>4 Eggs (hard boiled)</li>
        <li>2 Tomatoes</li>
        <li>8 Leaves of green salad</li>
        <li>100g mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. mustard</li>
        <li>12 slices of toast</li>
        <li>salt, pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the onions until hot and add the minced meat and garlic. Let everything fry for about 5 minutes.<br>Deglaze with the pizza tomatoes and the strained tomatoes.<br>Season with herbs, sugar, pepper, salt and a little chili - if you like.<br>For consistency, add the tomato paste, a whole tube if needed.</li><br>
        <li>Now fill the minced meat mixture thinly into a preferably square baking dish, so that the lasagne plates fit.<br>Put a layer of lasagna sheets on top, then minced meat and lasagna sheets again in alternation<br>(in my form the mass is enough for four layers).<br>Finish with ground meat mixture, season again with salt and pepper,<br>then spread the cup of sour cream on top. Finally, spread the package of cheese on top.</li><br>
        <li>The whole comes then with me for approx. 40 min. in the oven preheated to 175Â°C.</li>
    </ol>
